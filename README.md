## 📖 My Approach to Troubleshooting

**1. Reproduce the Issue**
I recreate problems in my own environment to understand them fully before attempting fixes.

**2. Gather Evidence**
Collect logs, screenshots, metrics—document everything before making changes.

**3. Systematic Diagnosis**
Work methodically from most likely cause to least likely, testing one variable at a time.

**4. Document Everything**
Every incident gets: problem statement, evidence, root cause, resolution steps, prevention.

**5. Learn & Improve**
After fixing, I ask: "How can I prevent this?" and "What can I automate?"
