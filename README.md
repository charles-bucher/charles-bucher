## 💼 What I'm Looking For

**Target Role:** Entry-Level Cloud Support Engineer | Junior DevOps Engineer | AWS Support Associate

**Work Preference:** Remote (Florida-based, supporting family of 5)

**What I Bring:**
- Self-taught AWS skills with hands-on production-style projects
- Strong troubleshooting methodology and documentation discipline
- Hunger to learn from experienced engineers and grow fast
- Real-world problem-solving experience (because nothing teaches you like broken systems)

**The Reality:**
- No degree. No certs yet. But every commit here is real work, real learning, and real troubleshooting.
- Working full-time as a delivery driver while building these skills nights and weekends.
- Three kids at home. Single income household. This isn't a hobby—it's a career shift with everything on the line.

I'm not looking for sympathy. I'm looking for a shot to prove I can do the work.
