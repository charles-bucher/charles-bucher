🎯 About Me

Entry-level AWS Cloud Support Engineer focused on troubleshooting, incident response, monitoring, and CloudOps automation. I build hands-on AWS lab environments that simulate real operational issues and document how to diagnose, remediate, and prevent them.

I specialize in learning by breaking things on purpose and fixing them the right way, using logs, metrics, and automation — not tutorials or click-through demos.

Actively seeking entry-level Cloud Support, CloudOps, or SysOps roles (remote or hybrid).
