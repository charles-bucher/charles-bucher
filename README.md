I’m a Cloud and IT Support practitioner specializing in AWS, Windows, and Linux environments, with a focus on hands-on labs, troubleshooting, and automation. I build practical solutions to simulate real-world cloud incidents and train problem-solving skills for technical support, operations, and cloud engineering roles.

Strong practical experience in EC2, S3, VPC, CloudWatch, CloudFormation, Terraform, Python, and automation scripts.
Self-taught, project-driven, with a focus on producing hire-ready portfolios and demonstrating measurable outcomes.
Passionate about automating workflows, creating reproducible labs, and documenting troubleshooting steps for teams or personal growth.
